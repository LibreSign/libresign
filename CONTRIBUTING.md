Contributing to LibreSign
=========================

Welcome
-------

We really appreciate everyone who would like to contribute to the LibreSign project!
There are many ways to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub,
helping people, assisting in triaging, reproducing, or fixing bugs that people have filed,
and enhancing our documentation. Also giving a star to the project is a really good way
to help and donate.

Before you get started, we encourage you to read our code of conduct, which describes our community norms:

1. [Our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which explicitly stipulates that everyone must be gracious,
respectful, and professional. This also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people to ask questions.

Quality Assurance
-----------------

One of the most useful tasks, closely related to triage, is finding and filing bug reports.
Testing beta releases, looking for regressions, creating test cases, adding to our test suites,
and other work along these lines can significantly improve the quality of the product.
Creating tests that increase our test coverage and writing tests for issues others have filed are invaluable contributions to open source projects.

If this interests you, feel free to dive in and submit bug reports at any time!

> browsers, long before I wrote a line of code for any open source project. â€”Hixie


Developing for LibreSign
------------------------

**NOTE**: If the project does not have an issue for what you want to do, create an issue first.

If you would prefer to write code, you may wish to start with our list of good first issues for [LibreSign](https://github.com/LibreSign/libresign/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
See the respective sections below for further instructions.
